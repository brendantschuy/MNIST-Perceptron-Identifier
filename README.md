<b>MNIST Perceptron Identifier</b>

This script employs the concepts of machine learning to a single layer perceptron array to
correctly identify handwritten numerals. 60,000 data entries are read in, pixel by pixel, in 
two separate array files to be used as a training data set. The perceptron learning rule is 
implemented, in part with the help of the computationally powerful NumPy library, and a 10,000
item testing data set is analyzed after the training set is complete.

Accuracy rates after 50 epochs tended to be in the 95-98% range.
